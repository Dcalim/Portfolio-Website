            <h2>Univerity of Guelph</h2>
            <h4>As a Software Engineering Student at the University of Guelph we primarily program in C, utilizing topics such as pointers, file I/O and Structures to complete assignments. 
                In addition, we touched upon Data Structures such as Linked Lists and Stacks to implement queues in class projects. I have also taken a class that focuses on the Software Design process,
                allowing me to get comfortable in methedologies such as Agile, Waterfall and Spiral. In my Software Design class, we used the Agile process method to create data analysis tools in python, setting up 
                sprints and scrum meetings to track progress. In particular, I focused on a tool that examines how the monthly variations in average weekly earnings across provinces and territories
                reflect seasonal patterns, applying classes such as matplot.lib and pandas for efficient data analysis.

            <h4>As a member of the Google Developers Students Club I participated in club meetings and workshops to learn new programming concepts and enhance my technical skills. 
                During club meetings we developed applications such as a joke generator which taught me essentials to creating a websitie, and how to fetch and display data from an API.
                We also developed a to-do list, which taught me the fundamentals of firebase, a popular app development platform.
